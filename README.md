# Welcome to Microtouch

Microtouch is a little device powered by the delightful Atmega32u4.
It features a 320x240 pixel touchscreen, an accelerometer, full speed
usb, a microsd card reader and a litium ion battery.

It has an application framework of sorts and it is possible to run a
variety of applications with varying degrees of utility. Possibilites
are bounded only by your imagination (and the 8 bit cpu + 2.5k of RAM).
